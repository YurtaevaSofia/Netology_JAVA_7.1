1.  **INSTRUCTION** coverage provides information about the amount of code that has been executed or missed.

2.  A source **LINE** is considered executed when at least one instruction that is assigned to this line has been executed.

3. **BRANCH** coverage is for all if and switch statements. This metric counts the total number of such branches in a method and determines the number of executed or missed branches.

4. JaCoCo also calculates cyclomatic **COMPLEXITY** (the minimum number of paths that can, in (linear) combination, generate all possible paths through a method) for each non-abstract method and summarizes complexity for classes, packages and groups. 
Complexity value can serve as an indication for the number of unit test cases to fully cover a certain piece of software.
